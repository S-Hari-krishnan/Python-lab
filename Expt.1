WEIGHT OF STEEL BAR

Aim:

To draw and write flowchart and algorithm for calculate the weight of steel rod.

Algorithm:

STEP1: start

STEP2: read the number of iron rods

STEP3: initialize I=0,total=0

STEP4: if I<n to check then get the diameter of the rod and calculate unit weight using formula D^2/162

STEP5: get the number of rods of diameter D

STEP6: calculate the weight of rod using no.of rod*D*unit weight. Then Total weight = TW+W

STEP7: increment value of I by 1. if I>n, display total as total weight of rod.

STEPS: stop
